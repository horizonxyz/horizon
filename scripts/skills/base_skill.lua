    The data we need is:
      - SCD
      - The state of the entity (status and status changes, map, coordinates, party information. not all data must be available upfront, but it must be possible to get party data from player for example)
      - Load the entity from the target Id (so we can validate the same statuses as the item above)
      - cast time information (it will be in the SCD[skill db data] but for the case of skills used by monsters the casttime is overwritten by the mob_skill_db)

    What will be defined and done here
      - If the casttime is 0 it will flag SCD to perform the skill imediatelly
      - If there is a cast time, it will start the casttime (maybe schedule it from a method in SCD)
      - Depending on the skill it can perform the cast skill animation (show cast bar and other effects, refer to herc's clif->useskill and ZC_USESKILL_ACK)
